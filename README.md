# Soft Wheat Yield Prediction in Italy

## Overview

The aim of this project is to create a regression model to predict soft wheat yields based on geographic data (altitude, latitude, and longitude) of the land, historical series (from 2006 to 2021) of cultivated areas, annual yields, and measurements of temperature and precipitation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/valeriodesiati/Soft-Wheat-Harvest-Prediction`.
2. Install the dependencies and run the Flask app: `./start`.
3. Visit the link `https://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.
